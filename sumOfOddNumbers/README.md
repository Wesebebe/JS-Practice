This is a codewars challenge. It states that:
Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1              sum = 1
          3     5           sum = 8
       7     9    11        sum = 27

13 15 17 19 sum = 64
21 23 25 27 29 sum = 125
...
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

1 --> 1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8
